    <h4 class="odd">DESCRIPTION</h4> <br>

    <p class="even">Marquee is a XOOPS module to create scrolling texts (marquees). You can
        create an unlimited number of marquees and use them in 4 blocks. Texts
        can scroll horizontally (from right to left or left to right) and
        vertically (from top to bottom and bottom to top). You can also set the
        loop, i.e. how many times should the marquee loop (from 1 to 100 times,
        and infinity).

        You can use a WYSIWYG editor to make your marquees even more
        attractive</p>
